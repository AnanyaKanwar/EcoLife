                                      <li><h3>Compost</h3></li>
                                      <p>Organic waste is naturally recycled into nutrient-rich soil through the process of composting. It entails the breakdown of organic matter by the action of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and worms, including food scraps, yard waste, and other biodegradable items. The organic waste is transformed through this process into compost, a black, crumbly material that is nutrient-rich and good for plant growth.</p>  
                                      <p>By keeping garbage out of landfills, composting lowers greenhouse gas emissions and methane production. It enhances soil aeration, water holding capacity, and soil structure, which benefits plant health and lowers the demand for chemical fertilisers. By fostering beneficial microbial species and earthworms in the soil ecosystem, compost also fosters biodiversity.</p>
                                      <p>Create a compost pile or use a compost bin in your backyard to compost successfully. For a balanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, combine "green" elements (such leftover fruit and vegetables, coffee grounds, and twigs) with "brown" ones (like leaves). To aerate the compost and hasten the decomposition process, turn it frequently. Meat, dairy, and greasy foods shouldn't be added because they can attract pests and hinder composting. If handled carefully, kitchen and garden waste can be converted into a useful resource that is good for the environment and your garden.</p><br>
